# DATA STRUCTURES

## Description

This project is a collection of assignments and projects developed as part of the Data Structures course. It focuses on implementing and analyzing fundamental data structures and algorithms, demonstrating how to efficiently organize, manage, and manipulate data to solve computational problems. This includes understanding trade-offs in time and space complexity.  

**Data Structures or Algorithms Employed**:  

- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Deques  
- Trees
- Graphs
- HashMaps and Hash Tables  
- Sorting
- Searching
