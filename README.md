# Applied-CS-Java-Portfolio
Welcome to my **Applied CS Java Portfolio**! This repository contains all of the exercises and projects I create during my time as a graduate student in the **Master of Science in Applied Computing** program at the **University of Oklahoma**. 

The projects demonstrate knowledge and growth as I explore CS topics with **Java**. This includes assignments, exercises, and projects that showcase a bit of programming and problem-solving skills.

### **What You'll Find Here**

This repository will be updated regularly with:

- **🧰 Exercises**: Smaller programs and practice tasks designed to reinforce specific concepts, such as Algorithms, Data Structures, and OOP principles.
- **🚀 Projects**: More complex assignments or personal projects.
- **📝 Documentation**: Each folder will contain a **README** with explanations, instructions, and insights about the project.
